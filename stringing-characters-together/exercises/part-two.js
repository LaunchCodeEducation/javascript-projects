//Part Two Section One

let dna = " TCG-TAC-gaC-TAC-CGT-CAG-ACT-TAa-CcA-GTC-cAt-AGA-GCT    ";

// First, print out the dna strand in it's current state.

//1) Use the .trim() method to remove the leading and trailing whitespace, then print the result.

console.log(/* Your code here. */);

//2) Change all of the letters in the dna string to UPPERCASE, then print the result.

console.log();

//3) Note that after applying the methods above, the original, flawed string is still stored in dna. To fix this, we need to reassign the changes to back to dna.
//Apply these fixes to your code so that console.log(dna) prints the DNA strand in UPPERCASE with no whitespace.

console.log(dna);

//Part Two Section Two

let dnaTwo = "TCG-TAC-GAC-TAC-CGT-CAG-ACT-TAA-CCA-GTC-CAT-AGA-GCT";

//1) Replace the gene "GCT" with "AGG", and then print the altered strand.

//2) Look for the gene "CAT" with ``indexOf()``. If found print, "CAT gene found", otherwise print, "CAT gene NOT found".

//3) Use .slice() to print out the fifth gene (set of 3 characters) from the DNA strand.

//4) Use a template literal to print, "The DNA strand is ___ characters long."

//5) Just for fun, apply methods to ``dna`` and use another template literal to print, 'taco cat'.
