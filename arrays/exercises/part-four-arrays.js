//Explore the methods concat, slice, reverse, and sort to determine which ones alter the original array.

//1) Print the result of using concat on the two arrays. Does concat alter the original arrays? Verify this by printing holdCabinet1 after using the method.

//2) Print a slice of two elements from each array. Does slice alter the original arrays?

//3) reverse the first array, and sort the second. What is the difference between these two methods? Do the methods alter the original arrays?
