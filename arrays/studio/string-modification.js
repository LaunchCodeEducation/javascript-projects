//Hint - define another variable to hold the new string or reassign the new string to str.

//2) Modify your code to accept user input. Query the user to enter the number of letters that will be relocated.

//3) Add validation to your code to deal with user inputs that are longer than the word. In such cases, default to moving 3 characters. Also, the template literal should note the error.
